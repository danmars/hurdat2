# Data Wrangling: HURDAT2 Data
## This notebook performs a comprehensive analysis of hurricane activity, leveraging data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and employing advanced geospatial techniques. It begins by extracting and meticulously preprocessing raw hurricane data, including parsing, cleaning, and formatting, culminating in a structured CSV file. Subsequently, web scraping is employed to acquire FIPS codes, enabling precise geographic mapping of hurricane events. Reverse geocoding is applied to enrich the dataset with location details corresponding to latitude and longitude coordinates. The analysis then focuses on Florida, isolating hurricane records since 1990 and conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA). Statistical summaries and visualizations reveal trends in hurricane frequency, both temporally (hurricanes per year) and spatially (hurricanes per county). Finally, the notebook harnesses the capabilities of the Plotly library to generate an interactive choropleth map, providing a compelling visualization of hurricane distribution across Florida counties. This geospatial representation enhances the understanding of hurricane patterns and potential impacts.
