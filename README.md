# This notebook begins by loading and parsing hurricane data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The raw data is cleaned, formatted, and ultimately saved to a CSV file.
# Then, the notebook demonstrates web scraping techniques to gather FIPS codes for Florida counties. This data is used later for geographic mapping.
# Reverse geocoding is applied to associate latitude and longitude coordinates with location details.
# The analysis then focuses on hurricane data specific to Florida since 1990. The dataset is further refined and visualized to explore trends such as hurricanes per year and hurricanes per county.
# Finally, the notebook utilizes the Plotly library to create an interactive choropleth map displaying the distribution of hurricanes across Florida counties.
